# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Why Isaac Changes Everything

When Tesla switched to NVIDIA Isaac for Optimus development, their simulation speed increased 100x. What took days now takes hours. What required physical prototypes now happens entirely in photorealistic digital environments.

## What You'll Build

**Chapter 9 (1000w):** Isaac Sim fundamentals - photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, Omniverse integration
**Chapter 10 (1200w):** Isaac ROS - hardware-accelerated perception, VSLAM, depth processing on Jetson
**Chapter 11 (1200w):** Nav2 for humanoids - path planning, obstacle avoidance, bipedal navigation

## Prerequisites
- Module 2 complete (Gazebo & Unity basics)
- RTX GPU (3060 Ti or better, 8GB+ VRAM)
- Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim 4.0+ installed

## The Isaac Advantage

Boston Dynamics uses Isaac Sim to generate millions of synthetic training images for Atlas's vision system. You'll learn this workflow—create perfect digital environments, train AI models, deploy to real robots.

**Module 3 gets you from basic simulation to AI-powered robotic perception.**
