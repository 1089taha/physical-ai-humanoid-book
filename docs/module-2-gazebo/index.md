# Module 2: The Digital Twin

## Why Simulation Wins

Tesla's Optimus humanoid doesn't start in a factory—it starts in a simulator. Before touching physical hardware, engineers crash it, drop it, and stress-test it digitally. Cost of virtual failure? $0. Cost of real failure? $50,000+.

## What You'll Build

**Chapter 6 (1000w):** Simulation fundamentals - physics engines, sim-to-real gap, when to use which tool
**Chapter 7 (1200w):** Gazebo mastery - spawn robots, simulate sensors, integrate ROS 2
**Chapter 8 (1200w):** Unity robotics - photorealistic environments, human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites
- Module 1 complete (ROS 2 basics)
- Ubuntu 22.04 + Gazebo Classic 11
- Unity 2022.3 LTS (Chapter 8 only)

## The Digital Twin Advantage

[DIAGRAM: Development cycle showing: Simulate → Test → Deploy → Repeat, with simulation loop being 1000x faster than physical loop]

Boston Dynamics runs millions of simulated hours before Atlas attempts new behaviors. You'll learn this workflow—design, simulate, validate, then build.

**Module 2 gets you from zero to simulating complex robot behaviors safely.**
