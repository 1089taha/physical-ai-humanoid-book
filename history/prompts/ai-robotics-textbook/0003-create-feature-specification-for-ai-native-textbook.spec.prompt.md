## 1. Goals & Success Metrics
**Primary Goal:** Deliver a deployed, spec-driven Docusaurus book augmented with a RAG chatbot that can answer questions about the content and answer strictly from selected text when requested.

**Success Metrics (judge-facing):**
- Book deployed and accessible: ✅
- Chatbot answers context queries reliably: ≥ 90% success on test prompts.
- Selected-text answers: 100% fidelity (if answer exists in text, reply from it; otherwise answer “Answer not found in selected text”).
- Load time for pages < 2s (desktop).
- Backend single-query end-to-end < 2s (excluding LLM latency).
- Repo contains README, architecture diagram, and demo video link.

---

## 2. High-level Product Features
- Docusaurus-based book, modular chapters, code samples, diagrams.
- FastAPI backend exposing `/chat` and `/embed` endpoints.
- Qdrant vector store for retrieval.
- Embeddings via OpenAI or Claude (configurable).
- ChatKit embed or custom React chat component.
- Selected-text-only mode with strict instruction to LLM.
- Optional: Better-Auth, Neon Postgres for personalization, Urdu translation agent.

---

## 3. Tech Stack & Rationale
- **Docusaurus** — simple, fast, ideal for docs + GitHub Pages. (Requirement)
- **FastAPI** — minimal, async, well-suited for ML microservices.
- **Qdrant Cloud** — free-tier vector DB; easy to integrate.
- **OpenAI (or Claude) embeddings + LLM** — best reliability for RAG; choose available provider.
- **Neon Postgres** (optional) — serverless, store user profiles, translation cache.
- **ChatKit/Agent Builder** — easiest embed for judge-visible chat; fallback to simple React chat.
- **Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code** — content generation and subagents.
- **GitHub Actions** — optional CI for deploy to gh-pages.

## 5. RAG Chatbot Specification & Selected-Text Behavior
This section describes how the RAG system should behave, the prompt engineering, and selected-text semantics.

### RAG Pipeline Overview
1. **Ingest**: Convert chapter markdown files → plaintext blocks; chunk (~400–600 tokens).
2. **Embed**: Compute embeddings (OpenAI or Claude).
3. **Store**: Upsert into Qdrant with payload `{id, text, chapter, url, heading, token_count}`.
4. **Query**: At chat time, embed query and search Qdrant for top-k (k = 5).
5. **Construct Prompt**: Build system + context + user prompt. Include citations in the form `[chapter:heading|url|offset]`.
6. **LLM**: Call model to answer and include explicit citations in the response.

### Selected-Text Mode (Strict)
- If frontend sends `selected_text` with the chat request, backend MUST:
  1. Immediately create a prompt that instructs the model:
     `"You MUST ONLY use the provided selected text to answer. If the selected text does not contain sufficient information to answer, you MUST say: 'Answer not found in selected text'."`
  2. Do NOT call Qdrant; the selected_text is the sole context.
  3. Return `sources: [{type: "selected_text", chapter: <chapter-if-available-or-null>, excerpt: <first 150 chars>}]`.

**Edge Cases:** If selected_text is too short to answer (> 20 chars recommended minimum), reply: `"Selected text insufficient to answer. Please provide more context or ask without selecting text." `

### Prompt Template (example)
```

## Response snapshot

The feature specification for "AI-Native Textbook — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" has been created on branch `1-ai-robotics-textbook`. The spec file is at `specs/1-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md` and the quality checklist at `specs/1-ai-robotics-textbook/checklists/requirements.md`. All checklist items are validated as complete, and the specification is ready for the next phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Feature specification created and validated for "AI-Native Textbook — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 2 files created: specs/1-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md, specs/1-ai-robotics-textbook/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan` as appropriate.
- 🧠 Reflection: Improved handling for script execution failures by manually creating branch and files when the automation script fails, ensuring continuity of task.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-new-feature.ps1` script failed to execute due to unexpected EOF, likely caused by complex string escaping issues when passing multiline JSON from bash to PowerShell. This required manual branch creation and file writing.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review and refine the `create-new-feature.ps1` script and its invocation to ensure robust handling of complex multiline string arguments in different shell environments. Consider alternative methods for passing large, complex data to scripts if direct string passing continues to be problematic.
